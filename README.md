# RAG-LLM-Gmail-Assistant
This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Gmail using OpenAI's GPT models. It fetches email data via the Gmail API and generates responses using OpenAI's API. The application includes Faiss for efficient similarity search, helping provide contextual responses based on retrieved emails.
